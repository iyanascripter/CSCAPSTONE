 <p><b><p><span id="name3">NEED STATEMENT
<br> 
 </span> The issue at hand is the lack of green spaces. This could lead to increased air pollution and temperature, as well as more storm water runoff. The lack of green spaces would mean fewer opportunities for people to engage in outdoor recreation, and the aesthetic of the city would likely become less appealing. This doesn't have a huge impact on many people, but the severity can be big depending on how you approach it. This issue has persisted for years in all areas in cities. Simply having access to green spaces in cities can do wonders for our stress levels and concentration at work or school. It is my overall goal for people to have access to greenery no matter where you stand.

 <p>The amount and quality of greenness in the local outdoor environment has repeatedly been linked to human well-being. Different types of green areas are likely required in order to meet the various needs of people throughout the course of their lives and with regard to individual social and economic living conditions. The aim of the present study was to increase the understanding of different pathways between green environments, well-being and health.

  <p>Street greenery is an indispensable component of urban vegetation to which residents have a higher frequency of access. Additionally, few studies focused on the disparity of the green view at a micro-level, such as at a county or community level. This study explored the spatial distribution of street greenery and its influential factors using the green view index as the main evaluation indicator. </p>

    <p>Greenery has always played an important role in the construction of cities. The need for green spaces has been present at city level since ancient times and throughout history.  Nowadays, given that the main part of the world population is living in cities, it can be said that greenery has a strategic importance. However, the city is currently dominated by building structures which are detrimental to green spaces, causing problems of congestion and pollution.

    <div class="divider">ANALYSIS</div>
    <b><p><span id="name77"> Based on these articles it is clear to note that without enough green space, occurring problems persist such as pollution and the declination of mental health. Urban environments typically have less green space, as there are more structures than green land. A known fact is that trees produce oxygen, and having less of them can cause congestion in the environment. </span>
