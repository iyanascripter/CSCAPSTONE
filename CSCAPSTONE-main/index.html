  The goal of Miss Green Gardening is to spread awareness of the lack of green space in communities. One of our missions is to potentially design garden maps by implementing ideas to help others become aware of their environment and to promote easy access to greenery. I have provided research and a study via google form which surveys students about this topic.<br>
  The issue at hand is the lack of green spaces. This could lead to increased air pollution and temperature, as well as more storm water runoff. The lack of green spaces would mean fewer opportunities for people to engage in outdoor recreation, and the aesthetic of the city would likely become less appealing. This doesn't have a huge impact on many people, but the severity can be big depending on how you approach it. This issue has persisted for years in all areas in cities. Simply having access to green spaces in cities can do wonders for our stress levels and concentration at work or school. It is my overall goal for people to have access to greenery no matter where you stand. 
 <br> My organization is focused on  another possible solution; creating a small activity where you can collect different types of plants and learn about each one and discover their benefits.
