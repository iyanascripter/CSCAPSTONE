 <p><b><p><span id="name3">NEED STATEMENT
<br> 
 </span> The issue at hand is the lack of green spaces. This could lead to increased air pollution and temperature, as well as more stormwater runoff. The lack of green spaces would mean fewer opportunities for people to engage in outdoor recreation, and the aesthetic of the city would likely become less appealing.
This doesn't have a huge impact on many people, but the severity can be big depending on how you approach it. This issue has persisted for years in all areas in cities.
Simply having access to green spaces in cities can do wonders for our stress levels and concentration at work. 
The solution I have created is to create a small game where you can collect different types of plants and learn about each one and discover their benefits and how it relates to health.
It is my overall goal for people to have access to greenery no matter where you stand.   </p>

  <b><p><span id="name3"><a href = "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es903183r">Green Nature/human Nature: The Meaning of Plants in Our Lives</a>
 <p>Green exercise is activity in the presence of nature. Evidence shows it leads to positive short and long-term health outcomes. This multistudy analysis assessed the best regime of dose(s) of acute exposure to green exercise required to improve self-esteem and mood (indicators of mental health)</p>

 <b><p><span id="name3"> <a href = "https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/14/2464">Urban Green Local Environment</a></span>
 <p>The amount and quality of greenness in the local outdoor environment has repeatedly been linked to human well-being. Different types of green areas are likely required in order to meet the various needs of people throughout the course of their lives and with regard to individual social and economic living conditions. The aim of the present study was to increase the understanding of different pathways between green environments, well-being and health.</p>

 <b><p><span id="name3"> <a href = "https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/10/8/871">Street Greenery and its Relationship with Socioeconomic Status</a></span>
  <p>Street greenery is an indispensable component of urban vegetation to which residents have a higher frequency of access. Additionally, few studies focused on the disparity of the green view at a micro-level, such as at a county or community level. This study explored the spatial distribution of street greenery and its influential factors using the green view index as the main evaluation indicator. </p>
